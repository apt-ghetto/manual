Appendix B Contributing

We need help
------------

We’re always making hints about contributing. Lubuntu, like most every open source project out there, relies on the contributions of volunteers to develop as well as to maintain.

…not code
---------

That does not mean you need to be a developer, either. Though there is some new code we write, this is relatively rare. Including upstream changes in our packaging can be a little advanced, but even that is not the sum total of what we do.
You have the skills necessary

If you’re nothing more than a user, you can help out with the following without really knowing much more than you already do:

 - `support <https://lubuntu.me/links/>`_ or ` `phab wiki <https://phab.lubuntu.me/w/support/>`_ (thanks to all the people that pipe up in IRC, the mailing list, and here!)
 - `documentation <https://phab.lubuntu.me/source/manual/>`_
 - `testing <https://phab.lubuntu.me/w/testing/>`_
 - `bug triage <https://phab.lubuntu.me/w/bugs/>`_

*And we could always use help with art/graphic design!*

No strings attached
-------------------

Contributions can be done on an extended basis (making becoming a Lubuntu Member easy) or can be little bits here and there. You can come and go as you like. You can work only on one issue you feel particularly strongly about, or you can get involved over a wide scope.

Free training
-------------

For those interested in a deeper understanding of the system or that would like to develop additional skills, the Lubuntu team is happy to provide assistance.

Why not join?
-------------

That said, you’re all users, so you all can contribute. For those of you that are not contributing, why not? For those of us that do contribute, we all have responsibilities in real life, including school, work and families, etc. And yet we find a little time here and there to sneak in a little help. What would encourage you to contribute?
