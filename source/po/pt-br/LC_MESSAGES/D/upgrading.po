"We are proud to present the highly anticipated release of Lubuntu 18.10! "
"This release comes with many changes, which will probably be overshadowed"
" by the move to the LXQt desktop environment. Naturally, an extremely "
"large change like this can cause problems, so **we strongly recommend you"
" back up your files**. Also, if your computer is one that runs on a "
"battery (such as a laptop), please ensure that the power is connected, as"
" it may take a while and unexpected power failures could be disasterous."

"command line and is useful for server upgrades. Unfortunately with main "
"Ubuntu dropping 32-bit upgrades, 32-bit upgrades from 18.04 to 18.10 are "
"not supported."
