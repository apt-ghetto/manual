"To search for which file extenstion you want to change to open in another"
" program you can search in the top box for that file format. On the left "
"is really long list of all mimetype that you can change but searching for"
" a particular one will be much faster. To expand a particular group of "
"mimetypes from the group on the left pres the :guilabel:`+` button.  To "
"collapse a group of mimetypes press the :guilabel:`-` button. Once you "
"find the filetype you want to change on the top right it tells you what "
"kind of file that mimetype is and shows the extensions. The current "
"default is shown on the lower right with a change button that brings up a"
" menu for you to change it to something else. To change a default press "
"the :guilabel:`Change` button and it brings up a menu to choose the new "
"default program for this kind of file."
