"We are proud to present the highly anticipated release of Lubuntu 18.10! "
"This release comes with many changes, which will probably be overshadowed"
" by the move to the LXQt desktop environment. Naturally, an extremely "
"large change like this can cause problems, so **we strongly recommend you"
" back up your files**. Also, if your computer is one that runs on a "
"battery (such as a laptop), please ensure that the power is connected, as"
" it may take a while and unexpected power failures could be disasterous."

"Naturalmente, un cambio extremadamente grande como este puede causar "
"problemas, por lo que ** recomendamos encarecidamente que realice una "
"copia de seguridad de sus archivos **. Además, si su ordenador funciona "
"con una batería (como un ordenador portátil), asegúrese de que la "
"alimentación esté conectada, ya que puede tardar un tiempo y los fallos "
"de alimentación inesperados pueden ser desastrosos."
