"We are proud to present the highly anticipated release of Lubuntu 18.10! "
"This release comes with many changes, which will probably be overshadowed"
" by the move to the LXQt desktop environment. Naturally, an extremely "
"large change like this can cause problems, so **we strongly recommend you"
" back up your files**. Also, if your computer is one that runs on a "
"battery (such as a laptop), please ensure that the power is connected, as"
" it may take a while and unexpected power failures could be disasterous."

"¡Estamos orgullosos de presentar el lanzamiento altamente esperado de "

"verán eclipsados por el cambio al entorno de escritorio LXQt. Naturalmente, "
"un cambio extremadamente grande como este puede causar problemas, por lo que "
"** recomendamos encarecidamente que realice una copia de seguridad de sus "
"archivos **. Además, si su ordenador funciona con una batería (como un "
"ordenador portátil), asegúrese de que la alimentación esté conectada, ya que "
"puede tardar un tiempo y los fallos de alimentación inesperados pueden ser "
"desastrosos."
