"Lubuntu offers two types of releases. The **Long Term Support** release, "

"supported for three years after the release date and does not contain new"
" features. Throughout the course of the cycle, the Ubuntu Kernel Team "
"will deliver **Hardware Enablement** updates, or **HWE** updates, to "
"Lubuntu via Linux kernel updates. Additionally, all currently-supported "
"Lubuntu releases use the **LXDE** desktop environment, which is the "
"traditional Lubuntu experience."

"For users looking to try new features every six months at the expense of "
"the support cycle length, Lubuntu offers **interim releases**, or "
"**regular releases**. These releases, while they are considered stable, "
"are testing grounds for major, new features which will be rolled into the"
" LTS release. Users of the regular releases are typically enthusiasts and"
" somewhat more experienced users looking for a fresher experience."
