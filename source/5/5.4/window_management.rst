Chapter 5.4 Window Management
=============================

Window are the area which contains the graphical user interface that we interact with programs. In Lubuntu these windows can typically be opened, closed, resized and minimized. Underneath Lubuntu uses Openbox as default a window manager. 

Using the mouse
---------------
In the top-right corner of a windows a few commands allow you basic controls of the window. Starting from left to right

-   Iconify (-) hides/minimizes the window making it only appear on the task bar of the Panel. It can be recalled by clicking on the application on the task bar, or cycling through open windows with :kbd:`ALT + Tab`. Another way to iconfigy is to middle click on the tittlebar. 
-   Maximize reshapes the window to fix the entire screen.
-   Close (x) attempts to end the window and probably the program.
