Useage
------
To use brightness click on the dial towards the right window of the window. To make the screen dimmer use the left arrow key or click on the dial and drag it towards the left.  If you want to make the screen more bright press the right arrow key or drag the dial towards the right. After doing this you will be asked to confirm the current brightness is ok while needing to select :guilabel:`yes`. If you do not respond it will go back to the old brightness which is useful because if you made your screen illegible it will revert to the old settings.
