Chapter 3.2.16 Window Effects
=============================

Window effects is a program to manage effects of the Compton X compositor. 


Version
-------
Lubuntu ships with version 0.4.0 of Window effects.

Useage
------
To toggle enable client side shadows press the Enable client side shadows checkbox. 

The opacity tab is for transparency settings. Setting Opacity to 1.00 makes it opaque while 0 makes it entirely clear. 

How to Launch
-------------
To launch window effects from the menu -> Prefrences -> LXQt Settings -> Window effects or run 

.. code:: 

   compton-conf 
  
from the command line. From LXQt configuration center press the gear button with a c in it to launch Window Effects. Of course for this to have any effect the compton compistor needs to be running so see chapter 3.2.13 for how to autostart applications.
