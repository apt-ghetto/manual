+Shortcomings
+------------
+
+While Bluedevil can handle most basic operations, some tasks need to be completed via the command line. Here are some common tasks:
+
+Listing Paired Devices
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+You can list the devices that are already paired by running the following:
+
+.. code::
+
+  $ bt-device -l
+  Added devices:
+  FOO BAR (00:11:22:33:44:55)
+
+Connect to Paired Device Manually
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+To connect to `FOO BAR`, you would run:
+
+.. code::
+
+  $ bluetoothctl connect 00:11:22:33:44:55
+  Attempting to connect to 00:11:22:33:44:55
+  [CHG] Device 00:11:22:33:44:55 Connected: yes
+  Connection successful
+
+Disconnect From Paired Device Manually
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+To disconnect from `FOO BAR`, you would run:
+
+.. code::
+
+  $ bluetoothctl disconnect 00:11:22:33:44:55
+  Attempting to disconnect from 00:11:22:33:44:55
+  [CHG] Device 00:11:22:33:44:55 ServicesResolved: no
+  Successful disconnected
+
+More Commands
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Running the following will give you many more options for configuration via the command line:
+
+.. code::
+
+  $ bluetoothctl -h
+
